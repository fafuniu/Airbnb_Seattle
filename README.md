- [Motivation](#motivation)



## Dataset

The dataset in this project is from a Kaggle competition. You could access it by this link (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).

## Motivation

In this article, I drive into the open data of Seattle Airbnb from Kaggle and try to answer some questions related to the rental prices.

-Q1. Which neighbourhoods have the most rooms? And which areas are the cheapest to live?
-Q2. The change of the average prices of Airbnb with time in a year/week
-Q3. The change of occupancy rate with time in a week
