## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There is no necessary libraries to run the code in thie repo beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Motivation

In this notebook, I drive into the open data of Seattle Airbnb from Kaggle and try to answer some questions related to the rental prices.

- Q1. Which neighbourhoods have the most rooms? And which areas are the cheapest to live?

- Q2. The change of the average prices of Airbnb with time in a year/week

- Q3. The change of occupancy rate with time in a week

The dataset in this project is from a Kaggle competition. You could access it by this link (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@fafun/a-peek-of-open-data-of-seattle-airbnb-c9c612978feb).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
